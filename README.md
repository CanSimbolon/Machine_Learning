All codes related to programming, [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), AI, and data science. I continuously update this repository to document my learnings for future references and to share the knowledge. Otherwise noted, I use Python3 on MacOS. 

I make most frequent updates to the folders with * sign. Happy learning!

## Never Stop Learning 

Because field of machine learning is changing rapidly, it is important to keep up with new techniques and constantly learn. Good thing is that there is so much information online but it is easy to get lost. Here, I want to document some useful online resources or tips. I put mostly free resources. 

### Fundamentals

- Probability: 
- Programming: 
- **Python Basics**: [Stanford CS231n - Python](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- **SQL**: You can learn this on the job but you should know some basics for interview. 
- Mathematics: Khan Academy's Linear Algebra 

### Intermediate

- **Machine Learning**: [Andrew Ng's ML Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), [Google Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) 
- **Deep Learning**: [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai), [fast.ai](https://fast.ai), [theschool.ai](https://theschool.ai)
- Hadoop, Spark, Distributed Computing. 

### Advanced (or more in depth)

- **Stanford's AI courses**: [ai.stanford.edu/courses](http://ai.stanford.edu/courses/)
- **Computer Vision**: [Stanford CS231n Home](http://cs231n.stanford.edu)
- **Reinforcement Learning**: [theschool.ai: move37](https://www.theschool.ai/courses/move-37-course/), [OpenAI](https://gym.openai.com)

### Textbooks / Reading 

- **Neural Network**: [Book: NNET and DL](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)
- **Text Analytics**: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/
- **Statistics and Machine Learning**: [Book: Intro to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
- **Statistics**: [Book: OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os)
- **TensorFlow**: [Hvass-Labs Tutorial](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials)


### Optional

- **Udacity's AB Testing**
