# Display Image

Need `display()` if you are trying to view the image while being called inside a function. 

```py 
from IPython.display import display, Image
display(Image(filename=img_path,width='400px'))

# or 
from IPython.display import display, Image
display(Image(filename=img_path,width=400))
```
