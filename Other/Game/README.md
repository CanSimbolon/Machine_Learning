## Mac Terminal Game 

I recently found out that there are hidden games on Mac that you can play through the terminal.

- Type `emacs` in the terminal and press `esc`.
- Type `x` then `tetris` and press `enter` to play the game.
- `/usr/share/emacs/22.1/lisp/play` contains list of games: 
	- tetris
	- pong
	- snake
	- solitaire
	- gomoku
	- 5x5
	- dunnet
	- landmark
