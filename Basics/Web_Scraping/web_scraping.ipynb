Abu Dhabi lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the Persian Gulf from the central western coast. The city proper had a population of 1.5 million in 2014.[4] Abu Dhabi houses federal government offices, is the seat of the United Arab Emirates Government, home to the Abu Dhabi Emiri Family and the President of the UAE, who is from this family. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and urbanisation, coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed the city into a large and advanced metropolis. Today the city is the country's centre of political and industrial activities, and a major cultural and commercial centre, due to its position as the capital. Abu Dh\""

      "('Abu Dhabi', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Abu Dhabi (US /ˈɑːbuː ˈdɑːbi/, UK /ˈæbuː ˈdɑːbi/; Arabic: أبو ظبي\\u200e Abū Ẓabī Emirati pronunciation [ɐˈbuˈðˤɑbi])[3] is the capital and the second most populous city of the United Arab Emirates (the most populous being Dubai), and also capital of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the largest of the UAE\\'s seven emirates. Abu Dhabi lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the Persian Gulf from the central western coast. The city proper had a population of 1.5 million in 2014.[4] Abu Dhabi houses federal government offices, is the seat of the United Arab Emirates Government, home to the Abu Dhabi Emiri Family and the President of the UAE, who is from this family. Abu Dhabi\\'s rapid development and urbanisation, coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed the city into a large and advanced metropolis. Today the city is the country\\'s centre of political and industrial activities, and a major cultural and commercial centre, due to its position as the capital. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $400-billion United Arab Emirates economy.[5]   \"Dhabi\" is the Arabic word for a particular species of native gazelle that was once common in the Arabian region. Abu Dhabi means father of the \"Dhabi\" (gazelle). It is thought that this name came about because of the abundance of Gazelles in the area and a folk tale involving Shakhbut bin Dhiyab al Nahyan.[6] Abu Dhabi is full of archaeological evidence that points to civilisations, such as the Umm an-Nar Culture, having been located there from the third millennium BCE. Settlements were also found farther outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi but closer to the modern city of Al Ain. There is evidence of civilisations around the mountain of Hafeet (Jebel Hafeet). This location is very strategic because it is the UAE’s second tallest mountain, so it would have great visibility. It also contains a lot of moisture in its springs and lakes, which means that there would have been more moisture thousands of years ago.[7] The origin of the name \"Abu Dhabi\" is uncertain. Meaning \"Father of the Gazelle\", when literally translated from Arabic, it probably referred to the few gazelles that inhabit the emirate. According to Bilal al-Budoor, assistant under-secretary for Cultural Affairs at the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development, \"The area had a lot of dhibaa [deer (plural)], and was nicknamed after that.\" An old story tells about a man who used to chase deer [dhabi (deer – singular)] and was named the \"father\" of the animal. Abu Dhabi\\'s original name was Milh \"salt\", possibly referring to the salty water of the Persian Gulf, or the ancient salt marshes that surround the city. Some Bedouins called the city Umm Dhabi (mother of deer), while British records refer to the place as Abu Dhabi. According to some historical accounts, the name Abu Dhabi was first used more than 300 years ago. The first word of Abu Dhabi is pronounced \"Bu\" by inhabitants on the city\\'s western coast. In the eastern part of the city, the pronunciation is \"Abu\".[3] The Bani Yas bedouin were originally centred on the Liwa Oasis. This tribe was the most significant in the area, having over 20 subsections. In 1793, the Al Bu Falah subsection migrated to the island of Abu Dhabi on the coast of the Persian Gulf due to the discovery of fresh water there. One family within this section was the Al Nahyan family. This family makes up the rulers of Abu Dhabi today.[8] Abu Dhabi worked in the pearl business and traded with others. According to a source about pearling, the Persian Gulf was the best location for pearls. Pearl divers dove for one to one-and-a-half minutes, and would have dived up to thirty times per day. There were no air tanks and any other sort of mechanical device was forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big toes to protect them while they searched for oysters.[9] The divers were not paid for a day’s work but received a portion of the season’s earnings.[10] In the 19th century, as a result of treaties (known as \"truces\" which gave the coast its name) entered into between Great Britain and the sheikhs of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, Britain became the predominant influence in the area.[11] The main purpose of British interest was to protect the trade route to India from pirates, hence the earlier name for the area, the \"Pirate Coast\". After piracy was suppressed, other considerations came into play, such as a strategic need of the British to exclude other powers from the region. Following their withdrawal from India in 1947, the British maintained their influence in Abu Dhabi as interest in the oil potential of the Persian Gulf grew.[12] In the 1930s, as the pearl trade declined, interest grew in the oil possibilities of the region. On 5 January 1936, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC), an associate company of the Iraq Petroleum Company, entered into a concession agreement with the ruler, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan al Nahyan, to explore for oil. This was followed by a seventy-five-year concession signed in January 1939. However, owing to the desert terrain, inland exploration was fraught with difficulties. In 1953, D\\'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of BP, obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession: Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA) was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later Total). In 1958, using a marine drilling platform, the ADMA Enterprise, oil was struck in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about 8,755 feet (2,669\\xa0m). This was followed in 1959 by PDTC’s onshore discovery well at Murban No.3.[13] In 1962, the company discovered the Bu Hasa field and ADMA followed in 1965 with the discovery of the Zakum offshore field. Today, in addition to the oil fields mentioned, the main producing fields onshore are Asab, Sahil and Shah, and offshore are al-Bunduq, and Abu al-Bukhoosh.[13] In 1904, German explorer, Hermann Burchardt, took many photographs of historical sites in Abu Dhabi, photos that are now held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.[14] The city of Abu Dhabi is on the southeastern side of the Arabian Peninsula, adjoining the Persian Gulf. It is on an island less than 250 metres (820\\xa0ft) from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and Mussafah Bridges. A third, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, designed by Zaha Hadid, opened in late 2010. Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to Saadiyat Island by a five-lane motorway bridge. Al-Mafraq bridge connects the city to Reem Island and was completed in early 2011. This is a multilayer interchange bridge and it has 27 lanes which allow roughly 25,000 automobiles to move per hour. There are three major bridges of the project, the largest has eight lanes, four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in.[15] Most of Abu Dhabi city is located on the island itself, but it has many suburban districts on the mainland, for example: Khalifa City A, B, and C;[16] Khalifa City Al Raha Beach;[17] Al Bahia City A, B, and C; Al Shahama; Al Rahba; Between Two Bridges; Baniyas; Shamkha; AL Wathba and Mussafah Residential. Gulf waters of Abu Dhabi holds world\\'s largest population of Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins.[18][19][20]  Abu Dhabi has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh). Sunny blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months of June through September are generally extremely hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above 38\\xa0°C (100\\xa0°F). During this time, sandstorms occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters.[21] The cooler season is from November to March, which ranges between moderately hot to mild. This period also sees dense fog on some days. On average, January is the coolest month in the year, while August is the hottest. Since the Tropic of Cancer passes through the emirate, the southern part falls within the Tropics. However, despite the coolest month having a 18.8\\xa0°C (65.8\\xa0°F) average, its climate is far too dry to be classed as tropical. Under the rule of the Department of Municipal Affairs, Abu Dhabi Central Capital District has its own local government. Members are selected through the emir. Councils such as the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council and the Regulation and Supervision Bureau are responsible for infrastructure projects in the city. Finances are mainly through the state government.  The city was planned under the guidance of Sheikh Zayed by Japanese architect Dr Takahashi in 1967 initially for a population of 40,000.[24] The density of Abu Dhabi varies, with high employment density in the central area, high residential densities in central downtown and lower densities in the suburban districts. In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium- and high-rise buildings. Abu Dhabi\\'s skyscrapers such as the notable Etihad Towers, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority Tower,[25] the National Bank of Abu Dhabi headquarters,[26] the Baynunah ( Hilton Hotel ) Tower.[27] and the Etisalat headquarters are usually found in the financial districts of Abu Dhabi.[28] Other notable modern buildings include the Emirates Palace with its design inspired by Arab heritage.[29] The development of tall buildings has been encouraged in the Abu Dhabi Plan 2030, which will lead to the construction of many new skyscrapers over the next decade, particularly in the expansion of Abu Dhabi\\'s central business district such as the new developments on Al Sowwah Island and Al Reem Island.[30] Abu Dhabi already has a number of supertall skyscrapers under construction throughout the city. Some of the tallest buildings on the skyline include the 382\\xa0m (1,253.28\\xa0ft) Central Market Residential Tower, the 324\\xa0m (1,062.99\\xa0ft) The Landmark and the 74-story, 310\\xa0m (1,017.06\\xa0ft) Sky Tower, all of them completed. Also many other skyscrapers over 150\\xa0m (492.13\\xa0ft) (500\\xa0ft) are either proposed or approved and could transform the city\\'s skyline. As of July 2008, there were 62 high-rise buildings 23 to 150\\xa0m (75.46 to 492.13\\xa0ft) under construction, approved for construction, or proposed for construction.[31] One of the most important architectural landmarks is the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. This is arguably one of the most [weasel\\xa0words] important architectural treasures of contemporary UAE society—and one of the most opulent in the world. It was initiated by the late president of the United Arab Emirates, HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fondly thought of as the father of the UAE.[32] Its design and construction reportedly \\'unites the world\\', using artisans and materials from many countries including Italy, Germany, Morocco, Pakistan, India, Turkey, Iran, China, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Greece and of course the United Arab Emirates.[33] More than 3,000 workers and 38 contracting companies took part in the construction of the mosque. Natural materials were chosen for much of its design and construction due to their long-lasting qualities, including marble, stone, gold, semi-precious stones, crystals and ceramics. Construction began on 5 November 1996. The maximum capacity is approximately 41,000 people and the overall structure is 22,412 square metres (241,240 square feet), the internal prayer halls were initially opened in December 2007.[32] As one of the most visited buildings in the UAE, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center was established to manage the day-to-day operations, as a place of worship and Friday gathering and as a centre of learning and discovery through its education and visitor programs.[34] Abu Dhabi has several parks and gardens and more than 400 kilometres (249 miles) of coastline, of which 10 kilometres (6 miles) are public beaches.[35] The Lake Park A view from Heritage Park Turmeric plants at the Heritage Park Inside the Heritage Park Directions Pole at the Heritage Park Watch Tower at the Heritage Park The UAE’s large hydrocarbon wealth gives it one of the highest GDP per capita in the world and Abu Dhabi owns the majority of these resources – 95% of the oil and 92% of gas.[36] Abu Dhabi thus holds 9% of the world’s proven oil reserves (98.2bn barrels) and almost 5% of the world’s natural gas (5.8\\xa0billion cubic metres or 200\\xa0billion cubic feet). Oil production in the UAE was in the region of 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2010,[37] and projects are in progress to boost production to 3m bpd. In recent years the focus has turned to gas as increasing domestic consumption for power, desalination and reinjection of gas into oil fields increases demand. Gas extraction is not without its difficulties, however, as demonstrated by the sour gas project at Shah where the gas is rich in hydrogen sulphide content and is expensive to develop and process.[13] In 2009, the government had been diversifying their economic plans. Served by high oil prices, the country’s non-oil and gas GDP has outstripped that attributable to the energy sector. Non-oil and gas GDP now constitutes 64% of the UAE’s total GDP. This trend is reflected in Abu Dhabi with substantial new investment in industry, real estate, tourism and retail. As Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer of the UAE, it has reaped the most benefits from this trend. It has taken on an active diversification and liberalisation programme to reduce the UAE’s reliance on the hydrocarbon sector. This is evident in the emphasis on industrial diversification with the completion of free zones, Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, twofour54 Abu Dhabi media free zone and the construction of another, ICAD II, in the pipeline. There has also been a drive to promote the tourism and real estate sectors with the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority and the Tourism and Development Investment Company undertaking several large-scale development projects. These projects will be served by an improved transport infrastructure with a new port, an expanded airport and a proposed rail link between Abu Dhabi and Dubai all in the development stages.[38] Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest emirate of the UAE in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per capita income. More than $1\\xa0trillion is invested worldwide in this city alone. In 2010, the GDP per capita also reached $49,600, which ranks ninth in the world after Qatar, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg and many others. Taxation in Abu Dhabi, as in the rest of the UAE, is nil for a resident and for a non-bank, non-oil company. Abu Dhabi is also planning many future projects sharing with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) and taking 29% of all the GCC future plannings. The United Arab Emirates is a fast-growing economy: in 2006 the per capita income grew by 9%, providing a GDP per capita of $49,700 and ranking third in the world at purchasing power parity. Abu Dhabi\\'s sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), currently estimated at US$875\\xa0billion, is the world\\'s wealthiest sovereign fund in terms of total asset value.[39] Etihad Airways maintains its headquarters in Abu Dhabi.[40] Abu Dhabi\\'s government is looking to expand revenue from oil and gas production to tourism and other sorts of things which would attract different types of people. This goal is seen in the amount of attention Abu Dhabi is giving to its International Airport. The airport, in 2009, experienced a 30%+ growth in passenger usage.[41] This idea of diversification of the economy is also seen in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030[42] planned by the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council. In this plan Abu Dhabi\\'s economy will be sustainable and not be dependent on any one facet or source of revenue. More specifically the non-oil portion of income is planned to be increased from about 40% to about 70%.[39] Many Hollywood and other national film production teams have used the UAE as filming locations. Whilst neighbouring Dubai gets a lot of attention, in recent years Abu Dhabi has become a popular destination. The Etihad Towers and Emirates Palace Hotel were some of the city\\'s landmarks used as filming locations for the movie Furious 7. In this movie, cars rush through the building and smash through the windows of the Etihad Towers.[43] The water supply in Abu Dhabi is managed by the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company. As of 2006[update], it supplied 560.2 MiGD (million imperial gallons per day) of water,[44] while the water demand for 2005–06 was estimated to be 511 MiGD.[45] The Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi (EAD) states that groundwater is the most significant source of water, as well as desalinated potable water, and treated sewage effluent. At 40.6 MiGD, the Umm Al Nar storage is the largest water source for Abu Dhabi, followed by the rivers Shuweihat and Taweelah.[46] With falling groundwater level and rising population density, Abu Dhabi faces a severely acute water shortage. On average each Abu Dhabi resident uses 550 litres (120\\xa0imp\\xa0gal; 150\\xa0US\\xa0gal) of water per day.[47] Abu Dhabi daily produces 1,532 tonnes of solid wastes which is dumped at three landfill sites by Abu Dhabi Municipality.[48][49] The daily domestic waste water production is 330 MiGD and industrial waste water is 40 MiGD. A large portion of the sewerage flows as waste into streams, and separation plants.[49] The city\\'s per capita electricity consumption is about 41,000 kWh and the total supplied is 8,367 MW as of 2007[update].[50] The distribution of electricity is carried out by companies run by SCIPCO Power and APC Energy.[51][52] The Abu Dhabi Fire Service runs 13 fire stations that attend about 2,000 fire and rescue calls per year. State-owned Etisalat and private du communication companies provide telephone and cell phone service to the city. Cellular coverage is extensive, and both GSM and CDMA (from Etisalat and Du) services are available. Etisalat, the government owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Abu Dhabi prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC — better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into Abu Dhabi in 1995. The current network is supported by a bandwidth of 6 GB, with 50,000 dialup and 150,000 broadband ports. Etisalat recently announced implementing a fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) network in Abu Dhabi during the third quarter of 2009 to make the emirate the world\\'s first city to have such a network.[53] Abu Dhabi in the 1970s was planned for a predicted topmost population of 600,000. Following the urban planning ideals of the time period, the city has high-density tower blocks, and wide grid-pattern roads.[54] The population density is at its apex on the most northerly part of the island. At this point the main streets have a large amount of 20- to 30-storey towers. These towers are in a rectangular pattern, and inside is an ordinary grid pattern of roads with low rise buildings such as 2-story villas or 6-story low-rise buildings. Due to this planning a modern city with tall offices, apartment buildings, broad boulevards and busy shops is present. Principal thoroughfares are the Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street. Abu Dhabi is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. The design of the inner city roads and main roads are quite organised. Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal streets are oddly numbered, while all vertical streets are evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche is Street #1, Khalifa is Street #3, Hamdan is Street #5, Electra street is Street #7 and so on. Conversely, Salam Street is St #8.[55] Mail is generally delivered to post-office boxes only; however, there is door-to-door delivery for commercial organisations. There are many parks throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however there is often an entrance fee for adults. The Corniche, the city\\'s seaside promenade, is about 7 kilometres (4.3\\xa0mi) in length, with gardens, playgrounds, and a BMX/skateboard ring.[56] In 2007 the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council (UPC) was established, which is the agency responsible for the future of Abu Dhabi’s urban environments and the expert authority behind the visionary Plan Abu Dhabi 2030 Urban Structure Framework Plan that was published in September 2007.[30] The UPC is also working on similar plans for the regions of Al-Ain and Al-Gharbia. Because of the rapid development of Abu Dhabi, a number of challenges to the city\\'s urban organisation have developed, among them: As the emirate covers 67,341\\xa0km2 (26,001\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), nearly 87% of the UAE, the population density is 21.73/km2 (56.3/sq\\xa0mi), making it the largest emirate in the UAE.[59] Abu Dhabi also ranks as the 67th most expensive city in the world, and the second most in the region behind Dubai.[60] As of 2014[update], 477,000 of 2,650,000 people living in the emirate were UAE nationals. Approximately 80% of the population were expatriates.[61] The median age in the emirate was about 30.1 years. The crude birth rate, as of 2005[update], was 13.6%, while the crude death rate was about 2%.[62] Article 7 of the UAE\\'s Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE.[63] The government subsidises almost 95% of mosques and employs all imams. A majority of mosques are Maliki or Muwahhid oriented.[64] The majority of the inhabitants of Abu Dhabi are expatriate workers from Nepal‚ India, Pakistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Philippines, the United Kingdom and various countries from across the Arab world. Some of these expatriates have been in the country for many decades with only a few of them awarded nationality[65] Consequently, English, Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani), Malayalam, Tamil, Tulu, Somali, Tigrinya, Amharic and Bengali are widely spoken.[66] The native-born population are Arabic-speaking Arabs who are part of a clan-based society. The Al Nahyan family, part of the al-Falah branch of the Bani Yas clan, rules the emirate and has a central place in society.[67] There are also Arabs who are from other parts of the Arab World. Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) is the city\\'s main aviation hub and the second busiest airport in the UAE. Passenger numbers at Abu Dhabi International Airport rose by 17.2 per cent in 2015, with more than 23 million travellers passing through its terminals during that year.[68] Public transport systems in Abu Dhabi include the Abu Dhabi public buses, taxis, ferries, and aeroplanes.[69] Street taxis are easily recognised. They are either silver with a yellow roof sign (newer taxis) or white and gold with a green roof sign (older taxis). All the old taxis have been phased out. There are no old taxis available for transportation anymore.[70] The first town bus entered service in about 1969 but this was all part of a very informal service. There are other inter-city buses departing the Abu Dhabi Dhabi central bus station; these inter-city buses are not only intra-emirate buses, but also inter-emirate services. On 30 June 2008 the Department of Transport began public bus service in Abu Dhabi with four routes.[71] There are also public buses serving the airport. In an attempt to entice people to use the bus system, all routes were zero-fare until the end of 2008.[72] The four routes, which operate between 6\\xa0am and midnight every day, run at a frequency of 10 to 20 minutes.[72] Within the first week of service the bus network had seen high usage. Some of the buses, which have a maximum capacity of 45 passengers, only had room for standing left. Some bus drivers reported as many as 100 passengers on a bus at one time.[73] Due to the new, zero-fare bus service success, many taxi drivers were losing business. Taxi drivers have seen a considerable decrease in the demand for taxis while lines were forming for the buses.[74] The service steadily expanded and by the end of 2008, 230 buses were in service. In 2009, the Department of Transport plans to have 21 bus routes in the city, operated by 820 buses. A total of 1,360 buses are expected to be in operation by 2010.[73] A massive expansion of public transport is anticipated within the framework of the government\\'s Surface Transport Master Plan 2030.[75] The expansion is expected to see 130\\xa0km (81\\xa0mi) of metro and 340\\xa0km (210\\xa0mi) of tramways and/or bus rapid transit (BRT) routes. Abu Dhabi has a diverse and multicultural society.[76] The city\\'s cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogeneous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals—first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by various Asian and European ethnicities in the 1950s and 60s. Abu Dhabi has been criticised for perpetuating a class-based society, where migrant workers are in the lower classes, and suffer abuse which \"is endemic to the system\".[77] Major holidays in Abu Dhabi include Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, Eid ul-Adha which marks the end of Hajj, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.[78] This unique socioeconomic development in the Persian Gulf has meant that Abu Dhabi is generally more tolerant than its neighbours, including Saudi Arabia.[79] Emiratis have been known for their tolerance; Christian churches, Hindu temples, and Sikh gurdwaras (but no synagogues) can be found alongside mosques. The cosmopolitan atmosphere is gradually growing and as a result, there are a variety of Asian and Western schools, cultural centres and themed restaurants. Abu Dhabi is home to a number of cultural institutions including the Cultural Foundation and the National Theater. The Cultural Foundation, while closed for reconstruction as of spring 2011, is home to the UAE Public Library and Cultural Center.[80] Various cultural societies such as the Abu Dhabi Classical Music Society have a strong and visible following in the city. The recently launched Emirates Foundation offers grants in support of the arts, as well as to advance science and technology, education, environmental protection and social development. The International Prize for Arabic Fiction (IPAF) will be based in Abu Dhabi. The city also stages hundreds of conferences and exhibitions each year in its state-of-the-art venues, including the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) which is the Persian Gulf\\'s largest exhibition centre and welcomes around 1.8\\xa0million visitors every year.[81] The Red Bull Air Race World Series has been a spectacular sporting staple for the city for many years, bringing tens of thousands to the waterfront.[82] Another major event is the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC). The diversity of cuisine in Abu Dhabi is a reflection of the cosmopolitan nature of the society. Arab food is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small shawarma to the upscale restaurants in the city\\'s many hotels. Fast food and South Asian cuisine are also very popular and are widely available. The sale and consumption of pork, though not illegal, is regulated and it is sold only to non-Muslims in designated areas.[83] Similarly, the sale of alcoholic beverages is regulated. A liquor permit is required to purchase alcohol; however, alcohol, although available in bars and restaurants within four or five star hotels, is not sold as widely as in its more liberal neighbour Dubai.[84] Shisha and qahwa boutiques are also popular in Abu Dhabi. Poetry in Abu Dhabi and the UAE is highly regarded and often is centric around the themes of satire, religion, family, chivalry and love. According to an article from an Abu Dhabi tourism page, sheikhs, teachers, sailors and princes make a large bulk of the poets within the UAE. A unique form of poetry to the UAE was formed in the 8th century by Al Khalil bin Ahmed and it was written in 16 metres (52 feet). The first known poet from the UAE, Ibn Majid, was born sometime between 1432 and 1437 in Ras Al Khaimah. According to the tourism page Majid came from a family of sailors and 40 of his works have survived. Another Emirati poet, Ibn Daher is from the 17th century. Daher is important because he used Nabati poetry (AKA Bedouin poetry), poetry written in the vernacular instead of the classical/religious Arabic. Other important poets from the UAE are Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880–1954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887–1959) and Abdulla bin Sulayem (1905–1976). These poets made headway in the field of Classical Arabic poetry as opposed to the Nabati poetry of the 17th century.[85] One of Ibn Masjid\\'s most prominent works is a book called, Kitab al-Fawa\\'id fi Usul \\'Ilm al-Bahr wa \\'l-Qawa\\'id (Book of Useful Information on the Principles and Rules of Navigation), and it was written in 1490. This book is effectually an encyclopædia about navigation and sailing in and around the Indian Ocean. Masjid also goes into detail about the intricacies and technologies of the Arab sailing techniques. An excerpt from his book is: Today in Abu Dhabi there is a group called the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation that works to preserve the art and culture of the city. According to an article from the English Pen Atlas Al jawaher wal la\\'li was the first manuscript to come out of the UAE. According to another article this book was written in the 1990s and was banned in the city for some time for making accusations about the ruling family.[87] Abu Dhabi is home to international and local private schools and universities, including government-sponsored United Arab Emirates University in Al-Ain, New York University, Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, New York Institute of Technology, Higher Colleges of Technology, New York Film Academy, Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi University in Abu Dhabi. These boast several languages that make up the population of the city. For example, the international business school established a campus in February 2010, offering an Executive MBA and executive education courses. New York University opened a government-sponsored satellite campus in Abu Dhabi in September 2010.[88] All schools in the emirate are under the authority of the Abu Dhabi Education Council. This organisation oversees and administers public schools and licenses and inspects private schools. From 2009, the Council has brought over thousands of licensed teachers from native English speaking countries to support their New School Model Program in government schools. Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) maintains a comprehensive after-school program for interested and talented jiu-jitsu students.[89] The Abu Dhabi Jiu-Jitsu Schools Program began in 2008 under the patronage of Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is a keen Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitor. The program launched in 14 schools for pupils in grades 6 and 7 and has since expanded to 42 government schools, with 81 Brazilian coaches brought in as instructors.[90] 9 to 13-year-old students are taught Brazilian jiu-jitsu as part of the curriculum. The plan is for up to 500 schools to be participating in the school-jitsu program by 2015. The project was set up by special request of HH Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan to the head coach of the Emirates jiu-jitsu team Carlos Santos, now also the managing director of the School-Jitsu Project.[91] Every year in the season of admissions an exhibition is launched in Abu Dhabi Exhibition Center under the supervision of the government.[92] Universities from every corner of the world exhibit their career programs and scholarship programs for globally bright students. This seems to be a well-defined platform for the students of all nationalities. Heriot-Watt University, University of Bolton, Cambridge University, Oxford University, the Petroleum Institute, Khalifa University and Abu Dhabi University attend. Abu Dhabi has four football stadiums: Al Jazeera Stadium, Al Wahda stadium and Sheikh Zayed Football Stadium (Zayed Sports City)and Hazza Stadium. ZSC also contains a tennis court, an ice rink, and a bowling alley. The Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium is located on the outskirts of the city and is currently home to the Pakistan Cricket Team. The stadium hosts at least two series per year in the last 4 years. In 2014, the stadium also hosted one leg of the Indian Premier League. It has also been considered as a venue for the B Pakistan Super League too. Football and cricket are very popular in the city. Many youth play football in parking lots nearby corniche because of the pleasant environment and enough space. Cricket is also popular because of South Asian expats. There have been many small competitions conducted between small-time football and cricket teams. Another location known as the Dome has been created for mainly football events among others. The purpose behind the development of the Dome@Rawdhat was to create a community football and sporting facility with indoor and outdoor pitches in the heart of the city of Abu Dhabi. Since 2009, Abu Dhabi has hosted a Formula One race every year in November at the Yas Marina Circuit. Motorsport is popular throughout the country and the circuit has also hosted other events such as the V8 Supercars series of Dubai. Engendering some criticism, the International Judo Federation refused to allow the Israeli flag nor the Israeli national anthem at the international games this year [93] in Abu Dhabi, with some referring to this action as anti-Semitic[94]. The 2007 film, The Kingdom, was filmed here, although the movie was about Saudi Arabia. Furious 7 (2015), had some scenes taken and/or based in Abu Dhabi. In Sex and the City 2 (2010), most of the plot takes place in Abu Dhabi, but the movie is not filmed there.[95] Abu Dhabi is twinned with:  ', 'Coordinates: 24°N 54°E\\ufeff / \\ufeff24°N 54°E\\ufeff / 24; 54 in the Arabian Peninsula\\xa0\\xa0(white) The United Arab Emirates (/juːˈnaɪtɪd ˈærəb ˈɛmɪrɪts/\\xa0(\\xa0listen); UAE; Arabic: دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة\\u200e Dawlat al-Imārāt al-\\'Arabīyah al-Muttaḥidah), sometimes simply called the Emirates (Arabic: الإمارات\\u200e al-Imārāt), is a federal absolute monarchy in Western Asia at the southeast end of the Arabian Peninsula on the Persian Gulf, bordering Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the south, as well as sharing maritime borders with Qatar to the west and Iran to the north. In 2013, the UAE\\'s population was 9.2 million, of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates.[7][8][9] The country is a federation of seven emirates, and was established on 2 December 1971. The constituent emirates are Abu Dhabi (which serves as the capital), Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain. Each emirate is governed by an absolute monarch; together, they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council. One of the monarchs (traditionally always the Emir of Abu Dhabi) is selected as the President of the United Arab Emirates. Islam is the official religion of the UAE and Arabic is the official language (although English, Urdu and Hindi languages are widely spoken, with English being the language of business and education particularly in Abu Dhabi and Dubai). The UAE\\'s oil reserves are the seventh-largest in the world while its natural gas reserves are the world\\'s seventeenth-largest.[10][11] Sheikh Zayed, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the first President of the UAE, oversaw the development of the Emirates and steered oil revenues into healthcare, education and infrastructure.[12] The UAE\\'s economy is the most diversified in the Gulf Cooperation Council, while its most populous city of Dubai is an important global city and an international aviation hub.[13][14] Nevertheless, the country remains principally reliant on its export of petroleum and natural gas.[2][15][16] The UAE is criticised for its human rights record, including the specific interpretations of Sharia used in its legal system.[17][18][19] The UAE\\'s rising international profile has led some analysts to identify it as a regional and middle power.[20][21]   It appears the land of the Emirates has been occupied for thousands of years. Stone tools recovered from Jebel Faya in the emirate of Sharjah reveal a settlement of people from Africa some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered at Jebel Barakah on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago.[22] There is no proof of contact with the outside world at that stage, although in time it developed with civilisations in Mesopotamia and Iran. This contact persisted and became wide-ranging, probably motivated by trade in copper from the Hajar Mountains, which commenced around 3000 BCE.[23] In ancient times, Al Hasa (today\\'s Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia) was part of Al Bahreyn and adjoined Greater Oman (today\\'s UAE and Oman). From the second century AD, there was a movement of tribes from Al Bahreyn towards the lower Gulf, together with a migration among the Azdite Qahtani (or Yamani) and Quda\\'ah tribal groups from south west Arabia towards central Oman. Sassanid groups were present on the Batinah coast. In 637, Julfar (in the area of today\\'s Ra\\'s al-Khaimah) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the Sassanian Empire.[24] The area of the Al Ain/Buraimi Oasis was known as Tu\\'am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.[25] The earliest Christian site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as Sir Bani Yas Island and which dates back to the 7th century. Thought to be Nestorian and built in 600 AD, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 AD.[26] It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 AD following trade routes. Certainly, by the 5th century, Oman had a bishop named John – the last bishop of Oman being Etienne, in 676 AD.[27] The spread of Islam to the North Eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, to the rulers of Oman in 630 AD, nine years after the hijrah. This led to a group of rulers travelling to Medina, converting to Islam and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sassanids, who dominated the Northern coasts at the time.[28] Following the death of Prophet Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the Muslim leaders. The Caliph Abu Bakr sent an army from the capital Medina which completed its reconquest of the territory (the Ridda Wars) with the bloody battle of Dibba in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost.[29] This assured the integrity of the Caliphate and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging Rashidun Caliphate. The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the \"versatile tribesman\", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres. These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the Bani Yas and Al Bu Falah of Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Liwa and the Al Bahrayn coast, the Dhawahir, Awamir and Manasir of the interior, the Sharqiyin of the east coast and the Qawasim to the North.[30] By the 16th century, ports in the Persian Gulf and part of the population that today form the coastal Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, came under the direct influence of the Ottoman Empire.[31][32] At the same time, the Portuguese, English and Dutch colonial forces also appeared in the Persian Gulf region, with the entire northern coast remaining under Persian rule throughout. By the 17th century, the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi.[33][34][35] The Portuguese maintained an influence over the coastal settlements, building forts in the wake of the bloody 16th century conquests of coastal communities by Albuquerque and the Portuguese commanders who followed him – particularly on the east coast at Muscat, Sohar and Khor Fakkan.[36] The southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British as the \"Pirate Coast\",[37][38] as boats of the Al Qawasim (Al Qasimi) federation based in the area harassed British-flagged shipping from the 17th century into the 19th.[39] British expeditions to protect the Indian trade from raiders at Ras al-Khaimah led to campaigns against that headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1809 and subsequently 1819. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a treaty to combat piracy along the Persian Gulf coast, giving rise to the term Trucial States, which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. Further treaties were signed in 1843 and 1853. Primarily in reaction to the ambitions of other European countries, namely France and Russia, the British and the Trucial Sheikhdoms established closer bonds in an 1892 treaty, similar to treaties entered into by the British with other Persian Gulf principalities. The sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. This treaty, the Exclusive Agreement, was signed by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain between 6 and 8 March 1892. It was subsequently ratified by the Viceroy of India and the British Government in London.[40] British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security. However, the British prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants.[41] The charge of piracy is disputed by modern Emirati historians, including the current Ruler of Sharjah in his 1986 book The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf.[42] In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at Khawr al Udayd and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans, whose flag was occasionally seen flying there. Khawr al Udayd was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, Percy Cox, confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan (\\'Zayed the Great\\') that Khawr al Udayd belonged to his sheikhdom.[43] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pearling industry thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The First World War had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl, that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.[44] The British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council,[45] and appointed Adi Bitar, Dubai\\'s Sheikh Rashid\\'s legal advisor, as Secretary General and Legal Advisor to the Council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed.[46] The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The Trucial Oman Scouts was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace. In 1955, the United Kingdom sided with Abu Dhabi in the latter\\'s dispute with Oman over the Buraimi Oasis, another territory to the south.[47] A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia would have settled the Abu Dhabi-Saudi border dispute, but this has not been ratified.[48] The UAE\\'s border with Oman was ratified in 2008.[49] In 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the trucial rulers not to sign concessions with foreign companies. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were agreed with local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.[50] APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement, which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC\\'s operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a 13,000-foot-deep (4,000-metre) bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million. In 1953, a subsidiary of BP, D\\'Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later Total) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer Jacques Cousteau.[51][52] In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from Hamburg, Germany, and positioned over the Umm Shaif pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama, a rock formation that would provide many valuable oil finds. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the Fateh oilfield off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with Iran).[53] PDTC had continued its onshore exploration activities, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry, but on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif.[54] In 1962, PDTC became the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals and roads. When Dubai\\'s oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern global city of Dubai.[55] By 1966, it had become clear the British government could no longer afford to administer and protect what is now the United Arab Emirates. British MPs debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the sheikhdoms. Secretary of State for Defence Denis Healey reported that the British Armed Forces were seriously overstretched and in some respects dangerously under-equipped to defend the sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government\\'s decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial Sheikhdoms, that had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates. The British Labour government rejected the offer.[56] After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.[57] Fears of vulnerability were realized the day before independence. An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the Tunb islands. The islands were taken by force, civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion.[58] A destroyer group approached the island Abu Musa as well. But there, Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi had already negotiated with the Iranian Shah, and the island was quickly leased to Iran for $3 million a year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi.[59] Bahrain became independent in August, and Qatar in September 1971. When the British-Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, they became fully independent.[60] The rulers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai decided to form a union between their two emirates independently, prepare a constitution, then call the rulers of the other five emirates to a meeting and offer them the opportunity to join. It was also agreed between the two that the constitution be written by 2 December 1971.[61] On that date, at the Dubai Guesthouse Palace, four other emirates agreed to enter into a union called the United Arab Emirates. Bahrain and Qatar declined their invitations to join the union. Ras al-Khaimah joined later, in early 1972.[62][63] In February 1972, the Federal National Council (FNC) was created; it was a 40-member consultative body appointed by the seven rulers. The UAE joined the Arab League in 1971. It was a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council in May 1981, with Abu Dhabi hosting the first summit. UAE forces joined the allies against Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The UAE supported military operations from the US and other coalition nations engaged in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan (2001) and Saddam Hussein in Iraq (2003) as well as operations supporting the Global War on Terror for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi. The air base also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and Operation Northern Watch. The country had already signed a military defense agreement with the U.S. in 1994 and one with France in 1995.[64][65] In January 2008, France and the UAE signed a deal allowing France to set up a permanent military base in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.[66] The UAE joined international military operations in Libya in March 2011. On 2 November 2004, the UAE\\'s first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, died. His eldest son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, succeeded as Emir of Abu Dhabi. In accordance with the constitution, the UAE\\'s Supreme Council of Rulers elected Khalifa as president. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan succeeded Khalifa as Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.[67] In January 2006, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, died, and the crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum assumed both roles. The first ever national elections were held in the UAE on 16 December 2006. A small number of hand-picked voters chose half of the members of the Federal National Council, an advisory body. UAE has largely escaped the Arab Spring, which other countries have had; however, more than 100 Emirati activists were jailed and tortured because they sought reforms. Furthermore, some people have had their nationality revoked.[68] A member of the ruling family in Ras al-Khaimah was put under house arrest in April 2012 after calling for political openness. Mindful of the protests in nearby Bahrain, in November 2012 the UAE outlawed online mockery of its own government or attempts to organise public protests through social media.[12] The United Arab Emirates is situated in Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and Saudi Arabia; it is in a strategic location slightly south of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit point for world crude oil.[69] The UAE lies between 22°30\\' and 26°10\\' north latitude and between 51° and 56°25′ east longitude. It shares a 530-kilometre (330\\xa0mi) border with Saudi Arabia on the west, south, and southeast, and a 450-kilometre (280\\xa0mi) border with Oman on the southeast and northeast. The land border with Qatar in the Khawr al Udayd area is about nineteen kilometres (12 miles) in the northwest; however, it is a source of ongoing dispute.[70] Following Britain\\'s military departure from the UAE in 1971, and its establishment as a new state, the UAE laid claim to islands resulting in disputes with Iran that remain unresolved. The UAE also disputes claim on other islands against the neighboring state of Qatar.[71] The largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, accounts for 87% of the UAE\\'s total area (67,340 square kilometres (26,000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi)). The smallest emirate, Ajman, encompasses only 259\\xa0km2 (100\\xa0sq\\xa0mi)(see figure). The UAE coast stretches for more than 650\\xa0km (404\\xa0mi) along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend far inland. The largest natural harbor is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the Al Bāţinah coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the Musandam Peninsula, the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an exclave of Oman separated by the UAE. South and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About 100\\xa0km (62\\xa0mi) to the northeast of Liwa is the Al-Buraimi oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. Lake Zakher is a human-made lake near the border with Oman. Prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the Al-Hajar al-Gharbi Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves. The oases grow date palms, acacia and eucalyptus trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of grasses and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on Bani Yas Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, Arabian Oryx, Arabian camel and leopards. Coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel, perch, and tuna, as well as sharks and whales. The climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above 45\\xa0°C (113\\xa0°F) on the coastal plain. In the Al Hajar Mountains, temperatures are considerably lower, a result of increased elevation.[72] Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between 10 and 14\\xa0°C (50 and 57\\xa0°F).[73] During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi (i.e. \"Easterner\") makes the coastal region especially unpleasant. The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than 120\\xa0mm (4.7\\xa0in), but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches 350\\xa0mm (13.8\\xa0in). Rain in the coastal region falls in short, torrential bursts during the summer months, sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds.[74] The region is prone to occasional, violent dust storms, which can severely reduce visibility. On the 28th of December, 2004, there was snow in the UAE for the very first time, in the Jebel Jais mountain cluster.[75] A few years later, there were more sightings of snow and hail.[76][77] The Jebel Jais mountain cluster in Ras al-Khaimah has experienced snow only twice since records began.[78] The United Arab Emirates is a federation of hereditary absolute monarchies. It is governed by a Federal Supreme Council made up of the seven emirs of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai, Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Qaiwain. All responsibilities not granted to the national government are reserved to the emirates.[79] A percentage of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE\\'s central budget.[80] Although elected by the Supreme Council, the presidency and prime ministership are essentially hereditary; the Emir of Abu Dhabi holds the presidency, and the Emir of Dubai is prime minister. All prime ministers but one have served concurrently as vice president. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was the UAE\\'s president from the nation\\'s founding until his death on 2 November 2004. On the following day the Federal Supreme Council elected his son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to the post. Abu Dhabi\\'s crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the heir apparent.[81] The UAE convened a half-elected Federal National Council in 2006. The FNC consists of 40 members drawn from all the emirates. Half are appointed by the rulers of the constituent emirates, and the other half are indirectly elected to serve two-year terms. However, the FNC is restricted to a largely consultative role.[82] The UAE eGovernment is the extension of the UAE Federal Government in its electronic form.[83] On 10 February 2016, 22-year-old Oxford and NYU-Abu Dhabi graduate Shamma Al Mazrui was named Minister of State for Youth Affairs, the youngest minister in the cabinet. Shaikh Mohammed noted that as head of the Youth Council, Al Mazrui will \"represent the hopes of our youth\".[84] The UAE is frequently described as an \"autocracy\".[85][86][87] According to the New York Times, the UAE is \"an autocracy with the sheen of a progressive, modern state\".[88] The UAE ranks poorly in freedom indices measuring civil liberties and political rights. The UAE is annually ranked as \"Not Free\" in Freedom House\\'s annual Freedom in the World report, which measures civil liberties and political rights.[89] The UAE also ranks poorly in the annual Reporters without Borders\\' Press Freedom Index. Al Nahyan family, one of the six ruling families of the United Arab Emirates, is believed to have a fortune of $150 billion collectively as a family.[90] The UAE has extensive diplomatic and commercial relations with other countries. It plays a significant role in OPEC and the UN, and is one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The UAE was one of only three countries to recognise the Taliban as Afghanistan\\'s legitimate government (Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the other two countries).[91] The UAE maintained diplomatic relations with the Taliban until 11 September attacks in 2001. A hacker group calling itself GlobalLeaks distributed hacked emails from the inbox of Yousef Al Otaiba, UAE\\'s Ambassador to US, which was covered by The New York Times, Huff Post and other major newspapers. Leaks show that the UAE supported a major effort to spread skepticism about Qatar in the United States. The New York Times further reported that UAE wanted to host Taliban embassy and used massive sums to influence decisions of D.C. diplomats.[92] The UAE has long maintained close relations with Egypt and is Egypt\\'s largest investor from the Arab world.[93] Pakistan was the first country to formally recognize the UAE upon its formation and continues to be one of its major economic and trading partners; about 400,000 Pakistani expatriates are employed in the UAE.[94] The UAE spends more than any other country in the world to influence U.S. policy and shape domestic debate,[95] and it pays former high-level government officials who worked with it to carry out its agenda within the U.S.[95] The largest expatriate presence in the UAE is Indian.[96][97] Following British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971 and the establishment of the UAE as a state, the UAE disputed rights to a number of islands in the Persian Gulf against Iran. The UAE went so far as to bring the matter to the United Nations, but the case was dismissed.[98] The dispute has not significantly impacted relations because of the large Iranian community presence and strong economic ties.[99] In its dispute with the United States and Israel, Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the strait at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, a vital oil-trade route.[12] Therefore, in July 2012, the UAE began operating a key overland oil pipeline which bypasses the Strait of Hormuz in order to mitigate any consequences of an Iranian shut-off. Commercially, the UK and Germany are the UAE\\'s largest export markets and bilateral relations have long been close as a large number of their nationals reside in the UAE.[100][101] Diplomatic relations between UAE and Japan were established as early as UAE\\'s independence in December 1971.[102] The two countries had always enjoyed friendly ties and trade between each other. Exports from the UAE to Japan include crude oil and natural gas and imports from Japan to UAE include cars and electric items.[102] France and the United States have played the most strategically significant roles with defence cooperation agreements and military material provision.[103] The UAE discussed with France the possibility of a purchase of 60 Rafale fighter aircraft in January 2013.[104] The UAE helped the US launch its first air offensive against Islamic State targets in Syria.[105] Although initially small in number, the UAE armed forces have grown significantly over the years and are presently equipped with some of the most modern weapon systems, purchased from a variety of outside countries, mainly France, the US and the UK (the former protector of the UAE). Most officers are graduates of the United Kingdom\\'s Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, with others having attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and St Cyr, the military academy of France. France opened the Abu Dhabi Base in May 2009. In March 2011, the UAE agreed to join the enforcement of the no-fly-zone over Libya by sending six F-16 and six Mirage 2000 multi-role fighter aircraft.[106] During the Gulf war, the US had troops and equipment stationed in the UAE as well as other parts of the Persian Gulf. In 2015, UAE participated in the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 uprising.[107] UAE has been secretly buying foreign weapons and American F-16 through offset payments which were channelled to DC thinktanks such as Middle East Institute.[108] On Friday 4 September 2015, at least 50 soldiers from the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were killed in Marib Area of central Yemen.[109] The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack which was conducted using a Soviet-era rocket known as Tochka.[110] It was later found out that this rocket targeted a weapons cache and caused a large explosion leading to the death of Emirati and Bahraini troops.[109] According to SIPRI, between 2012 and 2016, the UAE was the 3rd largest importer of arms among countries in the world.[111] The United Arab Emirates is divided into seven emirates. Dubai is the most populated Emirate with 35.6% of the UAE population. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has a further 31.2%, meaning that over two-thirds of the UAE population live in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai. Abu Dhabi has an area of 67,340 square kilometres (26,000 square miles), which is 86.7% of the country\\'s total area, excluding the islands. It has a coastline extending for more than 400\\xa0km (250\\xa0mi) and is divided for administrative purposes into three major regions. The Emirate of Dubai extends along the Persian Gulf coast of the UAE for approximately 72\\xa0km (45\\xa0mi). Dubai has an area of 3,885 square kilometres (1,500 square miles), which is equivalent to 5% of the country\\'s total area, excluding the islands. The Emirate of Sharjah extends along approximately 16\\xa0km (10\\xa0mi) of the UAE\\'s Persian Gulf coastline and for more than 80\\xa0km (50\\xa0mi) into the interior. The northern emirates which include Fujairah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, and Umm al-Qaiwain all have a total area of 3,881 square kilometres (1,498 square miles). There are two areas under joint control. One is jointly controlled by Oman and Ajman, the other by Fujairah and Sharjah. There is an Omani exclave surrounded by UAE territory, known as Wadi Madha. It is located halfway between the Musandam peninsula and the rest of Oman in the Emirate of Sharjah. It covers approximately 75 square kilometres (29 square miles) and the boundary was settled in 1969. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the Khor Fakkan-Fujairah road, barely 10 metres (33 feet) away. Within the Omani exclave of Madha, is a UAE exclave called Nahwa, also belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about eight kilometres (5.0 miles) on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about forty houses with its own clinic and telephone exchange. The UAE has a federal court system. There are three main branches within the court structure: civil, criminal and Sharia law. The UAE\\'s judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. UAE\\'s criminal and civil courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law. Flogging is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and alcohol consumption.[113][114][115] According to Sharia court rulings, flogging ranges from 80 to 200 lashes.[113][116][117] Verbal abuse pertaining to a person\\'s honour is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes.[118] Between 2007 and 2014, many people in the UAE were sentenced to 100 lashes.[119][120][121][122][123][124][125][126][127] More recently in 2015, two men were sentenced to 80 lashes for hitting and insulting a woman.[128] In 2014, an expatriate in Abu Dhabi was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 80 lashes after alcohol consumption and raping a toddler.[129] Alcohol consumption for Muslims is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many Muslims have been sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption.[130][131][132][133][134][135][136][137][138][139][140] Sometimes 40 lashes are given.[141] Illicit sex is sometimes penalized by 60 lashes.[142][143][144] 80 lashes is the standard number for anyone sentenced to flogging in several emirates.[145] Sharia courts have penalized domestic workers with floggings.[146] In October 2013, a Filipino housemaid was sentenced to 100 lashes for illegitimate pregnancy.[126] Drunk-driving is strictly illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many expatriates have been sentenced to 80 lashes for drunk-driving.[147][148][149][150][151][152][153] In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public.[154] Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes.[155] Stoning is a legal punishment in the UAE. In May 2014, an Asian housemaid was sentenced to death by stoning in Abu Dhabi.[156][157][158] Other expatriates have been sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery.[159] Between 2009 and 2013, several people were sentenced to death by stoning.[122][160][161] Abortion is illegal and punishable by a maximum penalty of 100 lashes and up to five years in prison.[162] In recent years, several people have retracted their guilty plea in illicit sex cases after being sentenced to stoning or 100 lashes.[163][164] The punishment for committing adultery is 100 lashes for unmarried people and stoning to death for married people.[165] Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction over family law cases and also have jurisdiction over several criminal cases including adultery, premarital sex, robbery, alcohol consumption and related crimes. The Sharia-based personal status law regulates matters such as marriage, divorce and child custody. The Islamic personal status law is applied to Muslims and sometimes non-Muslims.[166] Non-Muslim expatriates can be liable to Sharia rulings on marriage, divorce and child custody.[166] Apostasy is a crime punishable by death in the UAE.[167][168] Blasphemy is illegal; expatriates involved in insulting Islam are liable for deportation.[169] UAE incorporates hudud crimes of Sharia (i.e., crimes against God) into its Penal Code – apostasy being one of them.[170] Article 1 and Article 66 of UAE\\'s Penal Code requires hudud crimes to be punished with the death penalty;[170][171] therefore, apostasy is punishable by death in the UAE. In several cases, the courts of the UAE have jailed women who have reported rape.[172][173][174][175][176][177] For example, a British woman, after she reported being gang raped by three men, was charged with the crime of \"alcohol consumption\".[174][176] Another British woman was charged with \"public intoxication and extramarital sex\" after she reported being raped,[173] while an Australian woman was similarly sentenced to jail after she reported gang rape in the UAE.[173][174] In another recent case, an 18-year Emirati woman withdrew her complaint of gang rape by 6 men when the prosecution threatened her with a long jail term and flogging.[178] The woman still had to serve one year in jail.[179] In July 2013, a Norwegian woman, Marte Dalelv, reported rape to the police and received a prison sentence for \"illicit sex and alcohol consumption\".[173] Other laws discriminate against women. Emirati women must receive permission from a male guardian to marry and remarry.[180] This requirement is derived from the UAE\\'s interpretation of Sharia, and has been federal law since 2005.[180] In all emirates, it is illegal for Muslim women to marry non-Muslims.[181] In the UAE, a marriage union between a Muslim woman and non-Muslim man is punishable by law, since it is considered a form of \"fornication\".[181] Kissing in public is illegal and can result in deportation.[182] Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public.[183][184][185] In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public.[186] A new federal law in the UAE prohibits swearing in Whatsapp and penalizes swearing by a $68,061 fine and imprisonment;[187] expatriates are penalized by deportation.[187][188][189][190] In July 2015, an Australian expatriate was deported for swearing on Facebook.[191][192][193][194][195] Homosexuality is illegal and is a capital offense in the UAE.[196][197] In 2013, an Emirati man was on trial for being accused of a \"gay handshake\".[197] Article 80 of the Abu Dhabi Penal Code makes sodomy punishable with imprisonment of up to 14 years, while article 177 of the Penal Code of Dubai imposes imprisonment of up to 10 years on consensual sodomy.[198] Amputation is a legal punishment in the UAE due to the Sharia courts.[199][200][201][202][203] Crucifixion is a legal punishment in the UAE.[204][205][206] Article 1 of the Federal Penal Code states that \"provisions of the Islamic Law shall apply to the crimes of doctrinal punishment, punitive punishment and blood money.\"[207] The Federal Penal Code repealed only those provisions within the penal codes of individual emirates which are contradictory to the Federal Penal Code. Hence, both are enforceable simultaneously.[208] During the month of Ramadan, it is illegal to publicly eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset.[17] Exceptions are made for pregnant women and children. The law applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims,[17] and failure to comply may result in arrest.[209] Dancing in public is illegal in the UAE.[210][211][212] Flogging and stoning are legal punishments in the UAE. The requirement is derived from Sharia law, and has been federal law since 2005.[213] Some domestic workers in the UAE are victims of the country\\'s interpretations of Sharia judicial punishments such as flogging and stoning.[146] The annual Freedom House report on Freedom in the World has listed the United Arab Emirates as \"Not Free\" every year since 1999, the first year for which records are available on their website.[89] The UAE has escaped the Arab Spring; however, more than 100 Emirati activists were jailed and tortured because they sought reforms.[68][214][215] Since 2011, the UAE government has increasingly carried out forced disappearances.[216][217][218][219][220][221] Many foreign nationals and Emirati citizens have been arrested and abducted by the state. The UAE government denies these people are being held (to conceal their whereabouts), placing these people outside the protection of the law.[215][217][222] According to Human Rights Watch, the reports of forced disappearance and torture in the UAE are of grave concern.[218] The Arab Organization for Human Rights has obtained testimonies from many defendants, for its report on \"Forced Disappearance and Torture in the UAE\", who reported that they had been kidnapped, tortured and abused in detention centres.[217][222] The report included 16 different methods of torture including severe beatings, threats with electrocution and denying access to medical care.[217][222] In 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government.[223] Human rights organizations have spoken out against the secrecy of the trial. An Emirati, whose father is among the defendants, was arrested for tweeting about the trial. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail.[224] The latest forced disappearance involves three sisters from Abu Dhabi.[225][226] Repressive measures were also used against non-Emiratis in order to justify the UAE government\\'s claim that there is an \"international plot\" in which UAE citizens and foreigners were working together to destabilize the country.[222] Foreign nationals were also subjected to a campaign of deportations.[222] There are many documented cases of Egyptians and other foreign nationals who had spent years working in the UAE and were then given only a few days to leave the country.[222] Foreign nationals subjected to forced disappearance include two Libyans[227] and two Qataris.[222][228] Amnesty reported that the Qatari men have been abducted by the UAE government and the UAE government has withheld information about the men\\'s fate from their families.[222][228] Amongst the foreign nationals detained, imprisoned and expelled is Iyad El-Baghdadi, a popular blogger and Twitter personality.[222] He was arrested by UAE authorities, detained, imprisoned and then expelled from the country.[222] Despite his lifetime residence in the UAE, as a Palestinian citizen, El-Baghdadi had no recourse to contest this order.[222] He could not be deported back to the Palestinian territories, therefore he was deported to Malaysia.[222] In 2007, the UAE government attempted to cover up information on the rape of a French teenage boy by three Emirati locals, one of whose HIV-positive status was hidden by Emirati authorities.[229] Diplomatic pressure led to the arrest and conviction of the Emirati rapists.[230] In April 2009, a video tape of torture smuggled out of the UAE showed Sheikh Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan torturing a man (Mohammed Shah Poor) with whips, electric cattle prods, wooden planks with protruding nails and running him over repeatedly with a car.[231] In December 2009, Issa appeared in court and proclaimed his innocence.[232] The trial ended on 10 January 2010, when Issa was cleared of the torture of Mohammed Shah Poor.[233] Human Rights Watch criticised the trial and called on the government to establish an independent body to investigate allegations of abuse by UAE security personnel and other persons of authority.[234] The US State Department has expressed concern over the verdict and said all members of Emirati society \"must stand equal before the law\" and called for a careful review of the decision to ensure that the demands of justice are fully met in this case.[235] In recent years, a large number of Shia Muslim expatriates have been deported from the UAE.[236][237][238] Lebanese Shia families in particular have been deported for their alleged sympathy for Hezbollah.[239][240][241][242][243][244] According to some organizations, more than 4,000 Shia expatriates have been deported from the UAE in recent years.[245][246] The issue of sexual abuse among female domestic workers is another area of concern, particularly given that domestic servants are not covered by the UAE labour law of 1980 or the draft labour law of 2007.[247] Worker protests have been suppressed and protesters imprisoned without due process.[248] In its 2013 Annual Report, Amnesty International drew attention to the United Arab Emirates\\' poor record on a number of human rights issues. They highlighted the government\\'s restrictive approach to freedom of speech and assembly, their use of arbitrary arrest and torture, and UAE\\'s use of the death penalty.[249] In 2012, Dubai police subjected three British citizens to beatings and electric shocks after arresting them on drugs charges.[250] The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, expressed \"concern\" over the case and raised it with the UAE President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during his 2013 state visit to the UK.[251] The three men were pardoned and released in July 2013.[252] The treatment of migrant workers in the UAE has been likened to \"modern-day slavery\".[253] Migrant workers are excluded from the UAE\\'s collective labour rights, hence migrants are vulnerable to forced labour. Migrant workers in the UAE are not allowed to join trade unions.[254] Moreover, migrant workers are banned from going on strike.[254][255] Dozens of workers were deported in 2014 for going on strike.[256] As migrant workers do not have the right to join a trade union or go on strike, they don\\'t have the means to denounce the exploitation they suffer. Those who protest risk prison and deportation.[254] The International Trade Union Confederation has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour.[257] In July 2013, a video was uploaded onto YouTube, depicting a local driver hitting an expatriate worker, following a road related incident. Using part of his head gear, the local driver whips the expatriate and also taunts him, before other passers-by intervene. A short while later, Dubai police announced that the person who filmed the video had been taken into custody. It was also revealed that the local driver was a senior UAE government official.[258] Later in 2013, police arrested a US citizen and some UAE citizens, in connection with a YouTube parody video which allegedly portrayed Dubai and its residents in a bad light. The video was shot in areas of Satwa, Dubai, and featured gangs learning how to fight using simple weapons, including shoes, the aghal, etc.[259] In 2015, nationals from different countries were put in jail for offences. An Australian woman was accused of \\'writing bad words on social media\\', after she had posted a picture of a vehicle parked illegally. She was later deported from the UAE.[260] The State Security Apparatus in the UAE has been accused of a series of atrocities and human rights abuses including enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrests and torture,[261] the latest being the forced disappearance of Turkish businessman Dr Amer Al Shawa on 2 October 2014.[262] Freedom of association is also severely curtailed. All associations and NGOs have to register through the Ministry of Social Affairs and are therefore under de facto State control. About twenty non-political groups operate on the territory without registration. All associations have to be submitted to censorship guidelines and all publications have first to be approved by the government.[263] Secret Dubai was an independent blog in Dubai, from 2002 until 2010. It generated a significant following in the Middle East Blogosphere until the UAE\\'s Telecoms Regulatory Authority (TRA) in the UAE blocked the website. The UAE has a modest dress code. The dress code is part of Dubai\\'s criminal law.[264] Most malls in the UAE have a dress code displayed at entrances.[265] At Dubai\\'s malls, females should cover their shoulders and knees; therefore women are not permitted to wear sleeveless tops.[265][266][267] People can also wear swimwear at the pools and beaches. People are also requested to wear modest clothing when entering mosques, such as the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi. The UAE\\'s media is annually classified as \"not free\" in the Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House.[268] The UAE ranks poorly in the annual Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders. Dubai Media City and twofour54 are the UAE\\'s main media zones. The UAE is home to some pan-Arab broadcasters, including the Middle East Broadcasting Centre and Orbit Showtime Network. In 2007, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum decreed that journalists can no longer be prosecuted or imprisoned for reasons relating to their work.[269] At the same time, the UAE has made it illegal to disseminate online material that can threaten \"public order\". Criticism of the government is not allowed. Criticism of government officials and royal family members is not allowed. Prison terms have been given to those who \"deride or damage\" the reputation of the state and \"display contempt\" for religion.[270] There have been many politically motivated press freedom violations; for example in 2012 a YouTube user was arrested in Dubai for filming and uploading a video of a UAE local (who happened to be a Government official) hitting an overseas worker.[258] UAE has the second largest economy in the GCC (after Saudi Arabia),[271] with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $377 billion (1.38 trillion AED) in 2012.[272] Since independence in 1971, UAE\\'s economy has grown by nearly 231 times to 1.45 trillion AED in 2013. The non-oil trade has grown to 1.2 trillion AED, a growth by around 28 times from 1981 to 2012.[271] UAE is ranked as the 26th best nation in the world for doing business based on its economy and regulatory environment, ranked by the Doing Business 2017 Report published by the World Bank Group.[273] Although UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC, the UAE\\'s economy remains extremely reliant on oil. With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. Petroleum and natural gas continue to play a central role in the economy, especially in Abu Dhabi. More than 85% of the UAE\\'s economy was based on the oil exports in 2009.[15] While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its diversification policy.[12] In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE\\'s state budget.[16] Successful efforts at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on oil/gas output to 25%.[2] Dubai suffered from a significant economic crisis in 2007–2010 and was bailed out by Abu Dhabi\\'s oil wealth.[274] Dubai is running a balanced budget, reflecting economic growth.[275] Tourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy. Dubai is the top tourism destination in the Middle East.[175] According to the annual MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dubai is the fifth most popular tourism destination in the world.[276] Dubai holds up to 66% share of the UAE\\'s tourism economy, with Abu Dhabi having 16% and Sharjah 10%. Dubai welcomed 10 million tourists in 2013. The UAE has the most advanced and developed infrastructure in the region.[277] Since the 1980s, the UAE has been spending billions of dollars on infrastructure. These developments are particularly evident in the larger emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The northern emirates are rapidly following suit, providing major incentives for developers of residential and commercial property.[278] Property prices in Dubai fell dramatically when Dubai World, the government construction company, sought to delay a debt payment.[citation needed] UAE law does not allow trade unions to exist.[279] The right to collective bargaining and the right to strike are not recognised, and the Ministry of Labour has the power to force workers to go back to work. Migrant workers who participate in a strike can have their work permits cancelled and be deported.[279] Consequently, there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis – other GCC Arabs – getting preference in public sector jobs despite lesser credentials than competitors and lower motivation. In fact, just over eighty percent of Emirati workers hold government posts, with many of the rest taking part in state-owned enterprises such as Emirates airlines and Dubai Properties.[280] Dubai International Airport was the busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic in 2014, overtaking London Heathrow.[281] A 1,200\\xa0km (750\\xa0mi) country-wide railway is under construction which will connect all the major cities and ports.[282] The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula.[283] The major ports of the United Arab Emirates are Khalifa Port, Zayed Port, Port Jebel Ali, Port Rashid, Port Khalid, Port Saeed, and Port Khor Fakkan.[284] The UAE is served by two telecommunications operators, Etisalat and Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (\"du\"). Etisalat operated a monopoly until du launched mobile services in February 2007.[285] Internet subscribers were expected to increase from 0.904 million in 2007 to 2.66 million in 2012.[286] The regulator, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, mandates filtering websites for religious, political and sexual content.[287] UAE launched a successful bid for Expo 2020 with Dubai.[288][289] The win is unprecedented in the region.[290] World Expos are a meeting point for the global community to share innovations and make progress on issues such as the global economy, sustainable development and improved quality of life. World Expos can be a catalyst for economic, cultural and social transformation and generates legacies for the host city and nation.[291] Emirati culture is based on Arabian culture and has been influenced by the cultures of Persia, India, and East Africa.[292] Arabian and Persian inspired architecture is part of the expression of the local Emirati identity.[293] Persian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture and folk arts.[292] For example, the distinctive wind tower which tops traditional Emirati buildings, the barjeel has become an identifying mark of Emirati architecture and is attributed to Persian influence.[292] This influence is derived both from traders who fled the tax regime in Persia in the early 19th Century and from Emirati ownership of ports on the Persian coast, for instance the Al Qassimi port of Lingeh.[294] The United Arab Emirates has a diverse society.[295] Major holidays in the United Arab Emirates include Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.[296] Emirati males prefer to wear a kandura, an ankle-length white tunic woven from wool or cotton, and Emirati women wear an abaya, a black over-garment that covers most parts of the body.[297] Ancient Emirati poetry was strongly influenced by the 8th-century Arab scholar Al Khalil bin Ahmed. The earliest known poet in the UAE is Ibn Majid, born between 1432 and 1437 in Ras Al-Khaimah. The most famous Emirati writers were Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880–1954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887–1959) and Ahmed bin Sulayem (1905–1976). Three other poets from Sharjah, known as the Hirah group, are observed to have been heavily influenced by the Apollo and Romantic poets.[298] The Sharjah International Book Fair is the oldest and largest in the country. The list of museums in the United Arab Emirates includes some of regional repute, most famously Sharjah with its Heritage District containing 17 museums,[299] which in 1998 was the Cultural Capital of the Arab World.[300] In Dubai, the area of Al Quoz has attracted a number of art galleries as well as museums such as the Salsali Private Museum.[301] Abu Dhabi has established a culture district on Saadiyat Island. Six grand projects are planned, including the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and the Louvre Abu Dhabi.[302] Dubai also plans to build a Kunsthal museum and a district for galleries and artists.[303] Emirati culture is a part of the culture of Eastern Arabia. Liwa is a type of music and dance performed locally, mainly in communities that contain descendants of Bantu peoples from the African Great Lakes region.[298] The Dubai Desert Rock Festival is also another major festival consisting of heavy metal and rock artists.[304] The cinema of the United Arab Emirates is minimal but expanding. The traditional food of the Emirates has always been rice, fish, and meat. The people of the United Arab Emirates have adopted most of their foods from other West and South Asian countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India and Oman. Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries. Meat and rice are other staple foods; lamb and mutton are the more favored meats, than goat and beef. Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be complemented with cardamom, saffron, or mint to give them a distinct flavor.[305] Fast food has become very popular among young people, to the extent that campaigns are underway to highlight the dangers of fast food excesses.[306] Alcohol is allowed to be served only in hotel restaurants and bars. All nightclubs are permitted to sell alcohol. Specific supermarkets may sell alcohol, but these products are sold in separate sections. Note that although alcohol may be consumed, it is illegal to be intoxicated in public or drive a motor vehicle with any trace of alcohol in the blood.[307] Formula One is particularly popular in the United Arab Emirates, and is annually held at the picturesque Yas Marina Circuit. The race is held at evening time, and is the first ever Grand Prix to start in daylight and finish at night.[308] Other popular sports include camel racing, falconry, endurance riding, and tennis.[309] The emirate of Dubai is also home to two major golf courses: The Dubai Golf Club and Emirates Golf Club. In the past, child camel jockeys were used, leading to widespread criticism. Eventually the UAE passed laws banning the use of children for the sport, leading to the prompt removal of almost all child jockeys.[310] Ansar Burney is often praised for the work he has done in this area.[citation needed] Football is a popular sport in the UAE. Al Nasr SC, Al-Ain, Al-Wasl, Al-Sharjah, Al-Wahda, and Shabab Al Ahli Dubai are the most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time regional champions.[311] The United Arab Emirates Football Association was established in 1971 and since then has dedicated its time and effort to promoting the game, organizing youth programs and improving the abilities of not only its players, but also the officials and coaches involved with its regional teams. The UAE national football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1990 with Egypt. It was the third consecutive World Cup with two Arab nations qualifying, after Kuwait and Algeria in 1982, and Iraq and Algeria again in 1986. The UAE won the Gulf Cup Championship two times: the first cup in January 2007 held in Abu Dhabi and the second in January 2013, held in Bahrain.[312] The country is scheduled to host the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the UAE, largely because of the expatriate population from the SAARC countries, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in Sharjah has hosted four international test cricket matches so far.[313] Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi also hosted international cricket matches. Dubai has two cricket stadiums (Dubai Cricket Ground No. 1 and No. 2) with a third, the DSC Cricket Stadium, as part of Dubai Sports City. Dubai is also home to the International Cricket Council.[314] The UAE national cricket team qualified for the 1996 Cricket World Cup and narrowly missed out on qualification for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. They qualified for the 2015 Cricket World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand.[315][316] The next edition of the Asia Cup Cricket tournament is likely to be held next year in the first week of March.[317] The education system through secondary level is monitored by the Ministry of Education in all emirates except Abu Dhabi, where it falls under the authority of the Abu Dhabi Education Council. It consists of primary schools, middle schools and high schools. The public schools are government-funded and the curriculum is created to match the United Arab Emirates\\' development goals. The medium of instruction in the public school is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language. There are also many private schools which are internationally accredited. Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE, while the fees for private schools vary. The higher education system is monitored by the Ministry of Higher Education. The ministry also is responsible for admitting students to its undergraduate institutions.[318] The adult literacy rate in 2011 was 90%.[319][not in citation given][320][not in citation given][321] Thousands of nationals are pursuing formal learning at 86 adult education centres spread across the country.[322] The UAE has shown a strong interest in improving education and research. Enterprises include the establishment of the CERT Research Centers and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology and Institute for Enterprise Development.[323] According to the QS Rankings, the top-ranking universities in the country are the United Arab Emirates University (421–430th worldwide), Khalifa University[324] (441–450th worldwide), the American University of Sharjah (431–440th) and University of Sharjah (551–600th worldwide).[325] The demography of the UAE is extremely diverse. In 2010, the UAE\\'s population was estimated to be 8,264,070,[326] of whom only 13% were UAE nationals or Emiratis,[329] while the majority of the population were expatriates.[330] The country\\'s net migration rate stands at 21.71, the world\\'s highest.[331] Under Article 8 of UAE Federal Law no. 17, an expatriate can apply for UAE citizenship after residing in the country for 20 years, providing that person has never been convicted of a crime and can speak fluent Arabic.[332] There are 1.4 million Emirati citizens.[7] The United Arab Emirates\\' population is ethnically diverse. According to the CIA, 19% of residents were Emirati; 23% were other Arab (Egyptians; Jordanians); and Iranian; 50% were South Asian; and 8% were other expatriates, including Westerners and East Asians (1982 est.).[2] In 2009, Emirati citizens accounted for 16.5% of the total population; South Asian (Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Sri Lankans and Indians) constituted the largest group, making up 58.4% of the total; other Asians (Filipinos, Iranians)[333] made up 16.7%, while Western expatriates were 8.4% of the total population.[334] Indian and Pakistani expatriates make up more than a third (37%) of the population of three emirates – Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman according to the latest 2014 statistics provided by Euromonitor International, a market intelligence company. The five most populous nationalities in the three emirates, are: Indian (25%), Pakistani (12%), Emirati (9%), Bangladeshi (7%), and Filipino (5%).[335] There is a growing presence of Europeans especially in multicultural cities such as Dubai.[336] Western expatriates, from Europe, Australia, Northern America and Latin America make up 500,000 of the UAE population.[334][337] More than 100,000 British nationals live in the country.[338] The rest of the population were from other Arab states.[2][339] About 88% of the population of the United Arab Emirates is urban.[340] The average life expectancy was 76.7 in 2012, higher than for any other Arab country.[341][342] With a male/female sex ratio of 2.2 males for each female in the total population and 2.75 to 1 for the 15–65 age group, the UAE\\'s gender imbalance is second highest in the world after Qatar.[343] Islam is the largest and the official state religion of the UAE. The government follows a policy of tolerance toward other religions and rarely interferes in the activities of non-Muslims.[346] By the same token, non-Muslims are expected to avoid interfering in Islamic religious matters or the Islamic upbringing of Muslims. The government imposes restrictions on spreading other religions through any form of media as it is considered a form of proselytizing. There are approximately 31 churches throughout the country, one Hindu temple in the region of Bur Dubai,[347] one Sikh Gurudwara in Jebel Ali and also a Buddhist temple in Al Garhoud. Based on the Ministry of Economy census in 2005, 76% of the total population was Muslim, 9% Christian, and 15% other (mainly Hindu).[181] Census figures do not take into account the many \"temporary\" visitors and workers while also counting Baha\\'is and Druze as Muslim.[181] Among Emirati Muslim citizens, 85% are Sunni, while Shi\\'a are 15%, mostly concentrated in the emirates of Sharjah and Dubai.[181] Omani immigrants are mostly Ibadi, while Sufi influences exist too.[348] Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates. The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people.[349] Since the area was occupied by the British until 1971, English is the primary lingua franca in the UAE. As such, a knowledge of the language is a requirement when applying for most local jobs. Other world languages are represented by expatriate population drawn from a wide mix of nationalities. The life expectancy at birth in the UAE is at 76.96 years.[350] Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of death in the UAE, constituting 28% of total deaths; other major causes are accidents and injuries, malignancies, and congenital anomalies.[351] According to World Health Organisation data from 2014, 37.2% of adults in the UAE are clinically obese, with a Body mass index (BMI) score of 30 or more.[352] In February 2008, the Ministry of Health unveiled a five-year health strategy for the public health sector in the northern emirates, which fall under its purview and which, unlike Abu Dhabi and Dubai, do not have separate healthcare authorities. The strategy focuses on unifying healthcare policy and improving access to healthcare services at reasonable cost, at the same time reducing dependence on overseas treatment. The ministry plans to add three hospitals to the current 14, and 29 primary healthcare centres to the current 86. Nine were scheduled to open in 2008.[353] The introduction of mandatory health insurance in Abu Dhabi for expatriates and their dependants was a major driver in reform of healthcare policy. Abu Dhabi nationals were brought under the scheme from 1 June 2008 and Dubai followed for its government employees. Eventually, under federal law, every Emirati and expatriate in the country will be covered by compulsory health insurance under a unified mandatory scheme.[354] The country has benefited from medical tourists from all over the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf. The UAE attracts medical tourists seeking plastic surgery and advanced procedures, cardiac and spinal surgery, and dental treatment, as health services have higher standards than other Arab countries in the Persian Gulf.[355] ')\n"
