# Auto Push & Pull 

It became very repetitive that I had to pull and push github folders very often. I didn't want to keep typing the same commands such as 

- git add . 
- git commit -m 'sth'
- git push origin master 

Thus, I created this simple script file. Also, I created a shortcut from iterm so that it will automatically run these scripts. For example, I can type Command+A and it will run git_push.sh script.
