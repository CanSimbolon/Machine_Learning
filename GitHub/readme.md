## Removing Large File Cache from Commit History 

When you try to upload a large file, you will fail to push. Even after you delete those files, you will still not be able to push because those large files are cached in history. The following is a way to remove them. 

[Reference 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2100907/how-to-remove-delete-a-large-file-from-commit-history-in-git-repository)

```
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f file/location' HEAD
```

[Reference 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19573031/cant-push-to-github-because-of-large-file-which-i-already-deleted?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa)


```
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch <file/dir>' HEAD

# if you have more than one, you need to force it with -f
# this one always works for me (do git push right after this command)
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch <file/dir>' -f HEAD

# replace <file/dir> with your file's location 
```

[Reference 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19573031/cant-push-to-github-because-of-large-file-which-i-already-deleted/23657759#23657759)

```
git rm --cached giant_file
    # Stage our giant file for removal, but leave it on disk
git commit --amend -CHEAD
    # Amend the previous commit with your change
    # Simply making a new commit won't work, as you need
    # to remove the file from the unpushed history as well
git push
    # Push our rewritten, smaller commit
```

## Branching
```
git checkout -b my_branch # -b if the new branch does not exist
# do your dev work
git add .
git commit -m 'yo'
git push origin my_branch
# review pull requests on github.com
```

## Large Files 

- https://hackernoon.com/exclude-files-from-git-without-committing-changes-to-gitignore-986fa712e78d
- https://github.com/sr320/course-fish546-2015/issues/43
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4035779/gitignore-by-file-size

To automatically ignore large files 

```
find ./* -size +100M | cat >> .gitignore
# or 
find ./* -size +100M | cat >> .git/info/exclude
```

I found out that the above lines add `./` in the beginning of the file names and thus do not work. Solution is this: 

```
find . -size +100M | sed 's|^\./||g' | cat >> .git/info/exclude
```

To exclude duplicate files. 

```
find . -size +100M | sed 's|^\./||g' | cat >> .git/info/exclude; 
sort -u -o .git/info/exclude .git/info/exclude  ;  head .git/info/exclude 

```

The following did not work but shows the use case of `awk`

```
find . -size +100M | sed 's|^\./||g' | cat >> .git/info/exclude; awk '!NF || !seen[$0]++' .git/info/exclude
```
